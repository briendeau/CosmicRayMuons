# CosmicRayMuons
My cosmic ray muon-decay research project notebook I did for college graduation research.
Demonstrates algorithm design, data analysis techniques, and python programming skill.


I studied the energy-loss spectra of muons incident on our detector using a shielded cosmic ray detector in the basement of Ursinus College over several weeks.
A preview of some of the results are shown below.
